# Form Cero to Conversation

This repository contains dialogues that you can practice alone or with a partner.

The dialogues are inspired by the course from [Cero to Conversation by Qroo Paul on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ozf-mSpMFk&list=PLlo8JO-R9k-IWmsZRtZYzI7xiPdIUsfVq).

They aren't meant to be viewed in markdown, instead view the raw files.
